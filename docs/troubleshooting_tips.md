## Upload Issues
If users have issues during the uploading process, they can try to manually force the board into DFU mode with the reset button. Double-tapping the ++"RST"++ button will force the MCU to into the Device Firmware Update mode. The board will remain in this mode, until it power cycles *(which happens automatically, after uploading new firmware)* or the reset button is pressed.

<div markdown>

1. Double-tap the ++"RST"++ button
	- The `STAT` LED should be fading in/out very slowly
1. Users should now, be able to upload a new program
	- It shouldn't be necessary to select a COM port in the Arduino IDE; only the board needs to be selected
1. Once programming is complete, the MCU should reboot on its own. Otherwise:
	- Press the ++"RST"++ button
	- Power cycle the board

## &micro;SD Card

### Compatibility
The [FATFileSystem library](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-renesas/tree/main/libraries/FATFilesystem) built into the Renesas-Arduino core, supports &micro;SD cards with a **FAT32** file system *(i.e. SD cards **up to 32GB** in size)*.

- While users may be able to use cards with a higher storage capacity, we highly advise against it. As users may experience data loss due to a corrupt file system *(i.e. SD cards with a storage capacity greater than 32GB are not meant to be formatted with a FAT32 file system)*.

### Hot Swapping
To avoid corrupting an SD card, users should disable all activity with the SD card and disconnect power before removing it from the RA6M5 Thing Plus.
