## USB-C Connector
The USB connection is utilized for programming and serial communication. Users only need to plug their RA6M5 Thing Plus into a computer using a USB-C cable.

## Battery
For remote IoT applications, a Li-Po battery can be connected. Additionally, users may be interested in utilizing a [solar panel](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16835) and [USB-C cable](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14743) to recharge their battery.

!!! warning
	Users should avoid pulling on the wires of a battery to disconnect it from the board. Instead, it is recommended that a pair of dikes (i.e. diagonal wire cutters), pliers, or tweezers be used to pull on the JST connector housing, to avoid damaging the battery wiring.

## Breakout Pins
The [PTH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through-hole_technology "Plated Through Holes") pins on the RA6M5 Thing Plus are broken out into 0.1"-spaced pins on the edges of the board.

??? note "New to soldering?"

### Headers

Headers are versatile in their compatibility with shields, breadboards, or jumper wires.

### Hookup Wires

For a more permanent connection, users can solder wires directly to the board.

??? tip "Stackable Headers"
	Our [Feather Stackable Header Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15187) is a great option for stacking on shields *(w/ Feather footprint)* or on a breadboard; while leaving its pins still accessible.

## &micro;SD Card Slot
The RA6M5 Thing Plus includes a &micro;SD card slot on the back of the board. The cardholder functions through a push/pull operation. *(The card slot doesn't include a spring retention mechanism; cards are held in place through friction.)*

!!! info "SD Card Compatibility"
	The R6M5 Thing Plus supports &micro;SD cards with a **FAT32** file system *(i.e. only cards **up to 32GB** in size)*.

### Qwiic Devices
The Qwiic system allows users to effortlessly prototype with a Qwiic compatible I^2^C device without soldering. Users can attach any Qwiic compatible [sensor or board](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic#sensors), with just a [Qwiic cable](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15081). (*\*The example below, is for demonstration purposes and is not pertinent to the board functionality or this tutorial.*)
